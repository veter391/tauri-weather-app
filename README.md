# Weather Desktop App created by tauri

This application, built on Tauri, React and Rust, provides users with real-time weather information in their selected region. The combination of these two technologies ensures not only high performance but also reliability of the application.

Users can easily track the current temperature and cloudiness, viewing the information through a user-friendly interface. The application updates weather data automatically, ensuring its accuracy.

Thanks to Rust for optimized computations and React for creating a flexible user interface, this application offers the perfect balance between performance and ease of use.
